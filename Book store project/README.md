# Book Store Database

While doing distributed database course, my course teacher gave me 
some specific query operation on the dataset.

The condition here was, after connecting the database to Python, 
we can perform operations on the database.


# Conditions 

1. Choose a dataset 
2. Perform this operations on python
3. Insert minimum 30 data 
4. Partition the Main Table vertically, partition should be 3 parts. 
5. Insertion, Select, Projection, Deletion, Updating, Ordering, Grouping

## Installation

We can say that psycopg2 is a postgresql database adapter 
for python language. 

```bash
  pip install psycopg2
```

## Key responsibilities:
1. Collecting the data
2. Performed CRUD operations
3. In addition to CRUD operations, Insertion, Projection, Ordering,
and Grouping operations have been performed.
4. Perform database partition


## What I learned:
I got the idea about database partitioning how to partition database horizontally and vertically.
